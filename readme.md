# A python module template

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for a typical Python library following modern packaging conventions.

It utilizes popular libraries to fully automate all development and deployment tasks.


## Features

* Core:
  * [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as depdencies manager
  * [pep-0518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) alias `pyproject.toml` for managing dependencies, package metadata, ...
* Project tooling:
  * Formatting, Analysing with [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)
  * Type checking with `pyright`
  * Running tests with `pytest`
  * [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) for automating common development tasks
* Preconfigured setup for:
  * [Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):
    * 'package': launch an install/test/check on each push and pull request on 'main' branch.
    * 'release": on each tag push, launch:
      - a github release 
      - a pypi publish . You have to add a Trusted Publisher to an existing PyPI project(https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/).
      - a site documentation publication
  * [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to manage dependencies updates.
* Documentation:
  * Docstring styling with `pydocstyle`
  * Building documentation with `mkdocs`
  * Auto generation of API reference
  * Expose with documentation site under 'gh-pages' branch per default.


Until 2025/01/15, I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to rules them all. This work is still avalaible on `poetry`branch.


## About this project

In 2019, I worked on [template-python](https://github.com/geronimo-iia/template-python) which was based on [Jace's Python Template](https://github.com/jacebrowning/template-python).
For me, the goal was to be able to start quickly a new python project with all basics stuff ever configured, like :

- project definition using pytoml
- all lint tools (isort, black, ...)
- test unit ready to feed
- a basic documentation (about, api, etc...)
- a poetry command line utility (I'm not a big fan of long command line when i develop...)

In 2021, after two years of usage (for personal and work use), it was time to simplify all those things that we did not like: all little stich and glues around a project.

- We did not use [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/) anymore, ... Most often, our dev teams by-pass the pre-commit (nasty evils), so we let our ci doing his job (aka KillThemAll target).
- All tooling are configured using `pyproject.toml`, we wanna avoid the mess of configuration files...

In 2023, 4 year ever, python is always my favorite language (even if I start working around rust ...). It's time to another update:

- Documentation is always/often a painfull point. I had used a lot Sphinx, really like it, but mkdocs just do my things in a very simple way. So let's choose this way.
- flakehell could be replaced by ruff. Less configuration, and quicker so...
- add github action for check current change on build
- automate github release, publish on pypi, site documentation on a tag.

In 2024, we still use a lot of command into `makefile`, dependencies can be managed with dependabot on github, so in this flavour :

- Replace makefile with [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) as a poetry plugin
- add dependabot configuration to manage developement and production dependencies update.
- use dependencies group declaration:
  - `dev` group for all dev tools
  - `docs` group which can be installed with `poetry install --with docs`
- add option for package mode: set it to false when you want to use Poetry only for dependency management but not for packaging.
- Since python 3.12 and [PEP 696](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/): I quit [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), type checking should never be a pain...

In 2025, with the new release of poetry 2.0.0, I wanna make an update:

- use ruff as sucessor of isort and black (less dependency and tools)
- refactor poe the poet plugin installation with `tool.poetry.requires-plugins`
- simplify workflow and makefile
- update pyproject.toml declaration as our Python standard evolve :)

Few weeks later, my mates show me [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.
What I found very usefull:
- it's fast to resolve and install dependencies
- follow closely the pyproject.toml standardization
- more simple to manage than poetry
- you can handle complex dependencies nightmare https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/, & see your dependencies tree...
- you can develop localy with unreleased libraries
- to build our library : we can use setuptools
This tool still missing something like poetthepoet, but i hope that it could be integrated soon.
So let's have a try !



## Usage

Install `cookiecutter` and generate a project:

```
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter gh:geronimo-iia/python-module-template -f
```

or

```
git clone git@github.com:geronimo-iia/python-module-template.git
cd python-module-template
make generate

```

Cookiecutter will ask you for some basic info (your name, project name, python package name, etc.) and generate a base Python project for you.

Poe target list:

| Name             | Comment                                  |

You could retrieve those commands with `poe`. It will output something like this :

```
